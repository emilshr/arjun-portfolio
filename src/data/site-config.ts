The name “Glass Canteen” is inspired from the infamous cafeteria in the Delhi High Court which caters to people from all walks of life and is filled with spirit! It is often enjoyed as a space for vibrant discussions on law, life and politics which is precisely what this blog intends to do. Glass Canteen is a blog that is dedicated towards addressing contemporary issues in law concerning the courts and other institutions of democratic India. The blog is dedicated towards being a microcosm of such an inclusive space committed towards the spirit of democratic discourse and intellectual pluralism.',
